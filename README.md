The course material consists of two parts:

- [Hadoop and MapReduce](https://github.com/basecamp-uhh/big-data/blob/master/BA-Praktikum-2020-Big-Data.pdf)
- [Visualization and eployment on servers](https://github.com/basecamp-uhh/big-data/blob/master/BA-Praktikum-2020-Big-Data-Webserver.pdf)

The code examples are listed in separate projects:

- [Java MapReduce project](https://github.com/basecamp-uhh/Java-MapReduce)
- [Python MapReduce streaming project](https://github.com/basecamp-uhh/py-mapreduce)
